Its a big calculator

## Running
- Download Repo
- Have Python 3.10+ (See [link](#requirements))
- `python main.py`

## Requirements
This program needs Python 3.10+ as it uses the new `match`/`case` switcher. If you plan to fork it to remove the match-case and give support to older Python versions, note that this program also uses `math.lcm()` which is only available on Python 3.9+, as well as `math.gcd()`, introduced in Python 3.5.
